    "Before diving headfirst into the problem, let's start with some definitions. The bitwise exclusive OR (⊕) is an operation that, bit by bit for two operands, returns 1 if one and only one bit is 1, 0 otherwise (0 ⊕ 0 = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0, 1 ⊕ 0 = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1). To sum up with an example, 5 ⊕ 7 = 2, which is made clear by expressing the relationship with binary representations: 101 ⊕ 111 = 010, given that 1 ⊕ 1 = 0, 0 ⊕ 1 = 1, 1 ⊕ 1 = 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another concept that you'll need is the set of subarrays of an array, a subarray being any contiguous set of elements taken from the initial array. For example, given an array [x0, x1, x2], here is the set of all its subarrays: [x0], [x1], [x2], [x0, x1], [x1, x2], [x0, x1, x2]. As you can see, also the initial array belongs to the set.\n",

Please, make sure to provide a description of your reasoning and complement your code with very clear explanations of what each part does and why: if the reviewers can’t understand your algorithm despite a reasonable effort, they’ll have to consider your solution as wrong."
